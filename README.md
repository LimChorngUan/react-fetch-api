## React + fetch API

Over the past 3 years I have only been working with React + GraphQL + ApolloClient.
This little project is a playground for me to play around with [REST route](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) and [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/docs/).
